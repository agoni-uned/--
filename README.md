This repository contains the code with which the results presented in the article titled "Hybrid model for breast cancer detection using thermal images and clinical data" are obtained with.
This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks files.
  - Segmentation:    This notebook contains the script to train the different segmentation models tested in the article. The data used for this purpose is obtained from: https://visual.ic.uff.br/en/proeng/marques/
  - Experimentation: This notebook contains the script to pre-process the data (both the clinical data and the thermal images) and to train and evaluate the different classifiers tested in the article, including the clinical data classifiers,
                     the thermal image classifiers, and the ensemble models. The data needed for this purpose is availabkle upon sign up in: https://visual.ic.uff.br/dmi/. Recall that the data need to be cleansed before running the scripts.
